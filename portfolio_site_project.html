            My portfolio site, the source that likely drove you here.

        <div class="subSection" id="theHow">
          <h2 class="section-subheader"><span class="stepNumbers">&nbsp2&nbsp;</span> The How:</h2>
          <p>
          Once I decided I wanted to create a site I had to make the call on if I would start with a template or go forward on
          my own.  A template would certainly be easier, faster and likely look more refined. But that's not something I necessarily
          wanted.  I wanted to prove to myself, and to others, that I could overcome the challenge of developing it 100% on my own.
          If that meant that the site would be a bit gritty, so be it.<br><br>

          The first step was for me to write down the goals of what I wanted to accomplish with the site.  Some of the main themes included
          establishing a web presence, conveying personality, communicating my professional background and highlighting my coding journey.
          Evaluating if a choice I was making helped me achieve these goals or not helped me navigate the project.<br><br>

          Next up was to mock up wireframes of the site layout.  For this I turned to Adobe Comp and Adobe Sketch, my first time using both apps.
          Adobe Comp turned out to be a quick and easy way to visualize my ideas across devices.<br><br>

          With the general layouts defined, it was time to code.  I took a mobile-first approach, working my way up to larger screen sizes.
          </p>

        </div>

        <div class="subSection" id="result">
          <h2 class="section-subheader"><span class="stepNumbers">&nbsp3&nbsp;</span> The Result:</h2>
          <p>
          Ultimately, I'll let you be the judge of that. From my perspective I hit on most of my initial goals.  Would it have been cleaner built
          off of a template? Sure.  Would it have been as rewarding?  Hell no.  Over the coming months you will see enhancements being made to grow &amp;
          improve the site.  I am always open to feedback, so feel free to contact me!

          <h2 class="section-subheader"><span class="stepNumbers">&nbsp4&nbsp;</span> Challenges:</h2>
          <p>
          Building this site from a blank slate has been the largest coding initiative I've taken to date and presented a myriad of challenges for me.  When taking on a huge project like this it can be daunting to be at the starting point, looking up to the summit.  I found that this process was a great opportunity to practice getting in the developer mindset.
          Breaking things down into smaller chunks, working through one piece at a time and testing along the way.<br><br>

          Not starting with a template also meant trying to create a visually pleasing design, while managing all other aspects of developing a site.  This created some frustrations along the way.  It was an exercise in remaining patient while learning new tools and getting things to a point where I was happy.  Hopefully that effort is reflected in the site you see today.<br><br>

	        Another major challenge has been working through cross-browser issues.  All of the initial development testing was done in Chrome and all functionality, layouts, etc. worked great.  It was a wakeup call to see how many issues can arise across browsers.  I am still working through some of these but I have been able to address many of the major issues that occur.<br><br>

	        Lastly, the content...I hate talking about myself.  This is clearly an issue when trying to build a site around yourself.  To address this I decided to write most of the content in the 3rd person, which made it a bit easier.  While speaking this way any other time would be weird, it helped here.  Don't judge.
