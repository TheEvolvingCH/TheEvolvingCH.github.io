      				<p>		
					<strong>Since 2008</strong> Chris has worked across the media industry, starting out as a national TV media buyer before transitioning 
					to the world of ad-tech.  He has held roles across disciplines in Strategy, Account Management, Sales, Product &amp; Marketing.  Regardless 
					of his title, he seeks out opportunities to drive innovation by collaborating across the organization and having an in-depth understanding 
					of the business.<br><br>
				
					<img src="imgs/about.png" alt="photo of developer" id="aboutPhoto">

					Currently Chris is a Sr. Product Marketing Manager at Alliant, a data &amp; analytics company that services the ad industry, including agencies 
					and tech platforms.  He leads a multi-function Product team, overseeing product development, positioning, performance evaluation 
					and content generation.  This role shifted his course from a sales path, to that of product.<br><br>

					Outside of work you can find him spending time in Westchester County, NY with his wife and daughter, as well as his Australian shepherd Bruiser 
					(despite his name he is quite a softie).  Otherwise you will find him out on the golf course, on the ski hill, or on a hiking trail somewhere.  
					He also enjoys photography (all photos featured on this site were taken by Chris) and reading books or listening to podcasts by people who blend together entertainment and education to ignite curiosity, challenge traditional thinking and encourage people to push themselves.<br><br>

					Looking ahead, Chris will be continuing his journey to shift course and take his career further by learning to code.  Continue reading to see what he has been up to!

    	<h2 class="section-subhead">A Decision to Learn to Code</h2>
        		
      	<p>    		
      	<strong>Throughout his life</strong> Chris is surrounded by people who he has great admiration for.  A teacher who is helping shape the next generation of thoughtful minds, an architect who designs beautiful homes, a surgeon, a writer and the list goes on.  A common thread among each of these is a focus on building and creating.  As he reflected on his own career, he knew he wanted more of a focus on this as well and would have to find a way to expand beyond the advertising industry to do so.  This would require a new direction, one that brings together technical skill and creativity to create tangible, meaningful work.<br><br>
 
		Enter coding.<br><br>
 
		Once he realized he wanted to pursue coding, he barely knew where to begin, or if it was something he could legitimately pursue.  After starting off with some free resources online he ultimately found his home at Treehouse, exploring areas such as: 		
      	</p>
			
	    <ul>		
      		<li>HTML</li>		
      		<li>CSS</li>	
      		<li>JavaScript</li>		
     		<li>Python</li>	
      		<li>Git</li>
			<li>Design</li>
    	</ul>
			    		
      	<p>			
     	From early on he was hooked.  He continues to be driven by the unlimited possibilities that are opened by being able to take an idea from concept all the way through to reality.  It's what prompted him to build this site from scratch, why he is building projects to push his skills further, and why he is committed to being a lifelong learner.<br><br>
 
		The journey of learning to code has not been easy.  While he still has a long road ahead, he is proud of where he is today and feels it has been one of the best career decisions he has ever made.  Ultimately, his goal is to bring his new coding capabilities, along with his product, strategy &amp; management skills to a web development team.<br><br>
