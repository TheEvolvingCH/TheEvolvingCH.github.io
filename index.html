      				<p>
					<strong>Since 2008</strong> Chris has worked throughout the media industry, starting out as a national TV media buyer before transitioning
					to the world of ad-tech.  He has held roles across Strategy, Account Management, Sales, Product &amp; Marketing.  Regardless of his title, he seeks out opportunities to drive innovation by collaborating across the organization and having an in-depth understanding of the business.<br><br>

					<img src="imgs/about.png" alt="chris" id="aboutPhoto">

					Currently Chris is a Senior Product Marketing Manager at Alliant, a data &amp; analytics company that services the ad industry, including agencies and tech platforms.  He leads a multi-function Product team and oversees product development, positioning, performance evaluation
					and content generation.  This role has shifted his course from a sales path, to that of product.<br><br>

					Outside of work, you can find him spending time in Westchester County, NY with his wife and daughter, as well as his Australian Shepherd Bruiser
					(despite his name he is quite a softie).  Otherwise you will find him out on the golf course, on the ski hill, or on a hiking trail somewhere.
					He also enjoys photography (all photos featured on this site were taken by Chris), reading and listening to podcasts by people who blend together entertainment and education to ignite curiosity, challenge traditional thinking and encourage people to push themselves.<br><br>

					Chris will keep pursuing his dream to take his career further by learning to code.  Continue reading to see what he has been up to!

    	<h2 class="section-subhead">A Decision to Grow</h2>

      	<p>
      	<strong>Throughout his life</strong>, Chris is surrounded by people who he has great admiration for: a teacher who is helping shape the next generation of thoughtful minds, an architect who crafts intricate plans, an orthopedic surgeon, an author, and the list goes on.  The common thread among each of these is a focus on building and creating.  As he reflected on his own career, he knew he wanted a similar focus.  This required a new direction, one that brought together technical skill and creativity to produce tangible, meaningful work.<br><br>

		Enter coding.<br><br>

		Once he realized he wanted to pursue coding, he hardly knew where to begin, or if it was something he could legitimately pursue.  After starting off with some free resources online, he ultimately found his home at <a href="https://teamtreehouse.com" target="_blank" id="treehouseLink">Treehouse</a>, delving into areas such as:
		</p>

	    <ul>
      		<li>HTML</li>
      		<li>CSS</li>
      		<li>JavaScript</li>
     		<li>Python</li>
      		<li>Git</li>
			<li>Design</li>
    	</ul>

      	<p>
     	From early on he was hooked.  He continues to be driven by the unlimited possibilities of taking an idea from concept all the way through to reality.  It's what motivated him to build this site from scratch, why he is building projects to push his skill set further, and why he is committed to being a lifelong learner.<br><br>

		The journey of learning to code is complex.  He is proud of where he is today and knows it has been one of the best career decisions he has ever made.  Ultimately, his goal is to combine his coding capabilities with his product, strategy &amp; management skills on a web development team.<br><br>
