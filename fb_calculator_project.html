            A tool for team members to estimate how many people they can expect to target on
            Facebook and how many impressions they could potentially deliver.

          <h2 class="section-subheader"><span class="stepNumbers">&nbsp2&nbsp</span> The How:</h2>
          <p>
            The Facebook Audience Calculator was a side project  meant to tie together my learning with 
            my current role.  It was actually written in Python as a command line program initially.  
            However, once I realized that I could not distribute Python to the team due to network
            restrictions, I translated it to JavaScript and built a simple UI.
          </p>

          <p>
            Above you see the origination of the calculator, a boring Excel-based solution.  While
            it did the job, it was not very user-friendly and not very dynamic.  My goal was to set 
            out to create something more visually pleasing, easier to follow and something the sales 
            team could potentially use in client conversations.
          </p>

        <div class="subSection" id="result">
          <h2 class="section-subheader"><span class="stepNumbers">&nbsp3&nbsp</span> The Result:</h2>
          <p>
            After sharing the calculator with some team members in passing, I was encouraged to present
            the app at a monthly meeting I host with the Executive &amp; Management team.  The feedback has
            been positive and we are currently identifying the best way to bring it into the daily workflow of 
            the wider team.

            Looking ahead, I will be making improvements to the app, including the ability to forecast
            costs.  Keep an eye out for new changes!
