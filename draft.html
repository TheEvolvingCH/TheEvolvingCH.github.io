      <p>
        		
        <strong>Since 2008</strong> I have worked across the media and advertising industry, starting out as a national TV 
        media buyer, then transitioning to the world of ad-tech.  During this 
time I've had the opportunity to work with some 
        of the world's largest brands and agencies in a variety of roles, including Strategy, Account Management, Sales, Product 
        and Marketing.  Each step along the way I've had the benefit of owning roles that allowed me to partner across the organization, 
        providing a view into how all the individual efforts coalesce toward a common 
goal.<br><br>

	
			
        I always try to push myself to learn and be better, which has resulted in some changes along the way.

      <h2 class="section-subhead">A Decision to Learn to Code</h2>
        		
      <p>
           		
      Over time my career trajectory has veered away from sales &amp; account management and navigated towards product &amp; marketing.  
      This has been driven by my desire to bring together technical knowledge 
and creativity to generate more tangible work.  Overseeing 
      new product development, conceptualizing tools, generating content and shaping stories all have a realness that was lacking in media 
      sales.<br><br>

		
		
      Shifting focus has been a step in the right direction but I knew I needed to build upon it.  This was what led me to become a student 
      at Treehouse in early 2017, dedicating myself to learning to code.  The thought of being able to take an idea from concept all the way 
      to reality presents unlimited possibilities and really excites me.  From early on I have been hooked and have been committed 
to being a 
      lifelong learner since.  It's what prompted me to build this site by hand, why I am building projects to push my skills further, and why 
      I am interested in finding development opportunities.

      <h2 class="section-subhead">Away From the Office</h2>
       			
      <p>
				
      Outside of work you can find me spending most of my time with my family, including our Australian shepherd Bruiser (despite his name he is 
      quite a softee).  Otherwise you will have to track me down 
on the golf course, on the ski hill or on a hiking trail somewhere. 
      Keep up! <br><br>

				

      The journey of learning to code has not been easy, but has been one of the best decisions I have ever made professionally.  
      I'm more excited than ever about what may come next.  Feel free to contact me to hear more!
