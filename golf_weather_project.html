          <p>
          A quick and simple web app project to practice utilizing APIs, AJAX and jQuery.  The concept is geared around a user deciding
          if they want to play golf based on the weather forecast. If they decide to play they are brought to GolfNow.com, but
          if they don't they are shown the latest golf course photos on Flickr.<br><br>

          Since the primary focus here was on the processing of data, you will see that there was not much emphasis on the front-end design.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="subSection" id="theHow">
          <h2 class="section-subheader"><span class="stepNumbers">&nbsp2&nbsp;</span> The How:</h2>
          <p>
          In order to provide the user with weather, and in some cases golf course photos, I had to utilize two different APIs.  For this I
          turned to publicly available options in OpenWeatherMap and Flickr.  To handle the AJAX requests I turned to jQuery, as this is a quick
          and efficient way to process the data.<br><br>

    	    Once the data sources were confirmed, I designed a simple user flow that captures some basic info like their name and the zip-code of
    	    where they are looking to play.  The user name portion was an add-on so that I could also get some practice using local storage.  This
    	    way, if the user returns to the app they are presented a custom greeting rather than the general introduction.<br><br>

    	    For this app, I also decided to have the content of each section generated dynamically by jQuery, rather than controlling visibility of
    	    pre-built HTML elements.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="subSection" id="result">
          <h2 class="section-subheader"><span class="stepNumbers">&nbsp3&nbsp;</span> The Result:</h2>
          <p>
          The app successfully pulls in the user's local weather, providing them with the current weather conditions (temperature and weather description),
          as well as high and low temps for the day.<br><br>

          <!--<img src="imgs/" alt="Weather Results Screenshot">-->

    	    This could have just been a simple weather app but I wanted to include one of my favorite hobbies.  Having the ability to pull in the golf photos
    	    from Flickr helps bring home this idea, but also let me interact with more than one API.  A lot of additional functionality could be built into
    	    this app, such as asking additional qualifying questions to help the user determine if they can/can't play that day, or providing more ideal golf
    	    days based on an extended forecast.  For now, it has accomplished my main goal of pulling in dynamic data from other sites to power the user
    	    experience in my own app.

          <p>
          From a development perspective I had to scale back part of my initial idea. I wanted to tap into a third API so that the user would automatically be displayed local tee times in the area.
          Unfortunately, I was not able to find any free resources that would allow for this, so I reduced this to linking to GolfNow.<br><br>

          Other minor challenges I experienced were trying to not get to caught up in the design of the page, and handling event listeners on elements that were generated dynamically.<br><br>

          Until next time...
